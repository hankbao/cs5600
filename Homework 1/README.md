# Homework 1

## Part 1:  Chapter 4 simulator!

**Q1**: Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`.
What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the
CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the `-c` and `-p` flags to
see if you were right.

**A**: 100% CPU utilization. The process 0 run 5 instructions first, then the process 1 run 5 instructions also. As both processes had 100% chance to run an instruction according to the arguments we provided, so no I/O issued in this case. And the system will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN IO.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0

Important behaviors:
  System will switch when the current process is FINISHED or ISSUES AN IO
  After IOs, the process issuing the IO will run LATER (when it is its turn)
```

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p

**Q2**: Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`.
These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the
CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done.
How long does it take to complete both processes? Use `-c` and `-p`
to find out if you were right.

**A**: 11 time units. The process 0 run 4 instructions first, then the process 1 took 1 tick to issue an I/O, then waited 5 ticks for it to complete (as the default I/O length), plus 1 tick to handle the completion of that I/O.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:

**Q3**: Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens
now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use `-c`
and `-p` to see if you were right)

**A**: Only 7 time units are used this time. The switching of order matters as process 0 took 1 tick to issue an I/O, then turned into `BLOCKED` state and waited for 5 ticks for the I/O to complete. Just after it turned into `BLOCKED`, process 1 had been switched to run for 4 time units concurrently. After it took one more tick for process 0 to handle the completion of its I/O.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0

**Q4**: Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

**A**: It used 11 time units. The process 0 took 1 tick to issue an I/O, then turned into `BLOCKED` state and waited for 5 ticks for the I/O to complete, plus one more tick for the completion of I/O. The process 1 couldn't do CPU work concurrently. It had to wait until process 0 was done to run its own 4 instructions.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs
  1         RUN:io         READY             1
  2        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  3        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  4        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  5        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  6        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done         READY             1
  8           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
  9           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
 10           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
 11           DONE       RUN:cpu             1
```

**Q5**: Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use `-c` and `-p` to confirm that you are right.

**A**: It took 7 time units as the same result in A3. That's because the system switches process right after an I/O operation.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO -p
Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs

  2        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1

**Q6**: One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

**A**: It took 31 time units. The CPU was utilized by process 1 when the first I/O operation of process 0 was undergoing. The process 0 didn't get the chance to perform the other two I/O operations until process 2 and process 3 finished their using of CPU. The system resources were not effectively utilized as the CPU was idle for 10 time units.

```zsh
$ python process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p

**Q7**: Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

**A**: The system resources were effectively utilized as there was no CPU idle at all. The process 0 got the chance to perform the other two I/O operations immediately after the previous I/O operation was completed. Running a process that just completed an I/O again is a good idea as it could run another I/O operation immediately, thus other processes can run concurrently.

**Q8**: Now run with some randomly generated processes: `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` vs. `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` vs. `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

**A**: It's very difficult to predict how the trace will turn out as the introduction of randomness. Also the chance of running an instruction to the chance of performing an I/O is half to half.

The `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` flag makes the process just finished an I/O operation being switched to right away. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run at once; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running.

The `SWITCH_ON_IO` flag is definitely more effective than the `SWITCH_ON_END` flag as the former one switches process right after an I/O operation while the latter one switches process after the current process is finished, thus might block the CPU for a long time.
